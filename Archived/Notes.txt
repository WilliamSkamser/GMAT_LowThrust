1) The inital guess in Earth to Mars starts at zero thrust and ends at zero thrust
-> different than alpha and beta angles
-> mass flow rate still applied?

2) Need the alpha and beta angles for the LEO to GEO problem 
-> TOF
-> Mass flow Rate
-> Magnitude
-> Number of steps
-> Could be the same matlab data file as the first one. 

3) Note that the number of steps is very large. 
-> unlikly to be able to run it
-> need parallelism, run on cluster or dedacated computer.
